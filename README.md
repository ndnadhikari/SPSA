## Research Description:
Feature selection and ranking (FSR) has become an indispensable task in dealing with today's highly complex machine learning problems
with the massive number of features. So, FSR is growing topics of ‘Patron Recognition Problem’. We have proposed the novel approach of 
stochastic approximation to wrapper feature selection and feature ranking called simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA).
The experimental results over the benchmark datasets (publicly available datasets) shows that the proposed method (SPSA) performs reasonably
well than the other popular feature ranking algorithms. 

For comparability, we divided the wrapper comparison experiments into three sections below:

• Feature Selection in Classification Problems

• Feature Ranking in Classification Problems

• Feature Selection in Regression Problems
